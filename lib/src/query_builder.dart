  /// ### Expressions
  ///
  /// Expressions enable the creation of **logical**, **mathematical** and
  /// **relational** **statements**, which are used to apply rules, perform
  /// mathematical calculations on retrieved data, compare model objects and
  /// check the feasibility of a statement. **Expressions are also used to
  /// access data of model objects.**
  ///
  /// The basic expression types implemented by Altogic platform can be
  /// summarized as follows:
  ///
  /// * Mathematical
  /// * Logical
  /// * Relational
  /// * Informational \(data retrieval from model objects\)
  ///
  /// **Expressions are defined as combinations of operands and operators in
  /// a logical sequence.** Such a sequence may represent a mathematical
  /// calculation, logical reasoning, relational comparison or even an
  /// informational operation. ****Below are some expression examples.
  ///
  /// > 1. ```
  /// >    10 - 5
  /// >    ```
  /// > 2. ```
  /// >    (100 - 20) * 8
  /// >    ```
  /// > 3. ```
  /// >    'Altogic' + '-' + 'Backend as a service platform'
  /// >    ```
  /// > 4. ```
  /// >    (shoppingCart.totalPrice / SIZE(shoppingCart.items)) > 25
  /// >    ```
  ///
  /// The first expression above is a mathematical expression, the second one
  /// is again a mathematical expression but it is nested. The third one is a
  /// string manipulation expression and the last one is a combination of
  /// relational, informational and mathematical expressions, including the
  /// use of `SIZE` function. This last expression checks whether the average
  /// price of an item in an imaginary shopping cart object is greater than 25
  /// or not. As seen from the above examples, the expression types and
  /// combinations may differ from one expression to another, however,
  /// **the main rule is to keep combinations and types similar to each other**.
  /// That is the results of the expression operands evaluation, namely the
  /// values, must be of the same type to have a proper operator implementation.
  ///
  /// Expressions consist of **operands** and **operators**. An operand can be
  /// a **basic value** or an expression defined in terms of other expressions
  /// because expressions can be treated as recursive data structures.
  ///
  /// ### **Values**
  ///
  /// Each expression is formed by logically combining values. Values are
  /// actually primitive data types, but more complex data types such as lists
  /// and geo-points can also be used in expressions. A value can be a:
  ///
  /// | Value type | Examples |
  /// | :--- | :--- |
  /// | Boolean | `true` `false` |
  /// | Number | `134` `56.98` |
  /// | Text | `'Hello world!'` |
  /// | Datetime | `'2020-04-01T06:40:12.941+00:00'` |
  /// | List \(array of basic values\) | `['pop', '90s', 'urban', 'dance']` |
  /// | Geo-point \(longitude and latitude\) | `[29.032589793205258, 41.2200826257151]` |
  /// | Model field value | `profile.email` `address.city` |
  ///
  /// ### **Operators**
  ///
  /// Operators carry out all the computations by using the expression
  /// elements and can be classified into two main categories. They can be
  /// either **unary** or **binary**.
  ///
  /// **Unary operators** carry the calculations on a **single value**,
  /// namely on an operand, however, **binary operators** carry calculations
  /// on **two operands**, one on the left of the operator \(left operand\)
  /// and the other on the right \(right operand\).
  ///
  /// #### **Arithmetic operators**
  ///
  /// Arithmetic operators are used for mathematical calculations.
  ///
  /// | **Operator** | **Syntax** | **Description** |
  /// | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  /// | + \(unary\) | + Expression | Assigns a positive sign to expression |
  /// | + | Expression + expression | Adds the values |
  /// | - \(unary\) | - Expression | Assigns a negative sign to expression value |
  /// | - | Expression â€“ expression | Subtracts the values |
  /// | \* | Expression \* expression | Multiplies the values |
  /// | / | Expression / expression | Divides the values |
  ///
  /// > **Example:**
  /// >
  /// > ```
  /// > -(10 + ((10 * 5 - 4) / 100 - 20))
  /// > ```
  ///
  /// In the above expression, all the arithmetic operators are used. The
  /// expression is purely mathematical and it is nested. Moreover, the
  /// evaluation result of the expression value sign is converted to negative
  /// type by the unary minus operator.
  ///
  /// #### **Logical operators**
  ///
  /// Logical operators are used to evaluating an expression to **true** \(1\)
  /// or **false** \(0\).
  ///
  /// | **Operator** | **Syntax** | **Description** |
  /// | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  /// | && | Expression && expression | Logical AND returns true \(1\) only if both expressions evaluate to a nonzero value; otherwise it returns false \(0\). |
  /// | \|\| | Expression \|\| expression | Logical OR returns true \(1\) if either of the expressions evaluates to a nonzero value; otherwise it returns false \(0\). |
  /// | ! | !Expression | Logical negation returns false \(0\) if the expression evaluates to a nonzero value; otherwise it returns true \(1\). |
  ///
  /// > **Example:**
  /// >
  /// > ```
  /// > (profile.firstName && profile.lastName) || profile.fullName
  /// > ```
  ///
  /// As it can be seen that the expression uses a combination of both logical
  /// && and \|\| operators. It uses three field values of an imaginary
  /// 'profile' model. Initially, the expression in parenthesis will be
  /// evaluated, which performs a logical AND conditioning on the first two
  /// attributes. The result obtained from this evaluation will next be
  /// combined with the evaluation result of the last expression operand
  /// \(profile.fullName\) and the final result will be either evaluated to
  /// true or false.
  ///
  /// Instead of the logical operators, you can also use **AND** function
  /// for &&, **OR** function for \|\| and NOT function for ! operator. Using
  /// the functions instead of operators the above example can be written as:
  ///
  /// ```
  /// OR(AND(profile.firstName, profile.lastName), profile.fullName)
  /// ```
  ///
  /// #### **Relational operators**
  ///
  /// Like logical operators, relational operators are also used to evaluate
  /// an expression to **true** \(1\) or **false** \(0\).
  ///
  /// | **Operator** | **Syntax** | **Description** |
  /// | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  /// | == | Expression == expression | Checks equality of expressions; if the expressions are equal, it returns true \(1\) otherwise, it returns false \(0\) |
  /// | != | Expression != expression | Checks not equality of expressions; if the expressions are not equal, it returns true \(1\) otherwise, it returns false \(0\) |
  /// | &lt; | Expression &lt; expression | Checks whether the first expression is less than the second one; if the first expression is less than the second one, returns true \(1\) otherwise, it returns false \(0\) |
  /// | &gt; | Expression &gt; expression | Checks whether the first expression is greater than the second one; if the first expression is greater than the second one, returns true \(1\) otherwise, it returns false \(0\) |
  /// | &lt;= | Expression &lt;= expression | Checks whether the first expression is less than or equal to the second one; if the first expression is less than or equal to the second one, returns true \(1\) otherwise, it returns false \(0\) |
  /// | &gt;= | Expression &gt;= expression | Checks whether the first expression is greater than or equal to the second one; if the first expression is greater than or equal to the second one, returns true \(1\) otherwise, it returns false \(0\) |
  ///
  /// > **Example:**
  /// >
  /// > ```
  /// > task.completionDate > task.dueDate
  /// > ```
  ///
  /// The expression above uses a relational greater than operator. It checks whether the completion time is later than the due date of an imaginary task object.
  ///
  /// #### Altogic specific operators
  ///
  /// | **Operator** | **Syntax** | **Description** |
  /// | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  /// | \[ \] | \[expression, expression, ...\] | This bracket operator specifies that the expressions which are separated by commas between the brackets are members of a list \(array\) |
  /// | " " | "text" | This operator specifies that the expression between the double quotation is a text value. |
  /// | ' ' | 'text' | This operator specifies that the expression between the quotation is a text value. |
  ///
  /// > **Examples:**
  /// >
  /// > 1. ```
  /// >    '10' + '20' + '30'
  /// >    ```
  /// > 2. ```
  /// >    'Result : ' + (10 * 5 + 100)
  /// >    ```
  /// > 3. ```
  /// >    SIZE([45,26,94,73]) == 4
  /// >    ```
  ///
  /// The first expression illustrates a basic string concatenation operation.
  /// The characters between the double quotes are treated as a string. The
  /// second and the third strings are concatenated to the first one, which
  /// results in this final string: `102030`. The second expression is a
  /// special one and evaluation result of this expression is `Result : 150`.
  /// This is again a string concatenation operation but the second expression
  /// is evaluated as a mathematical one and the result is converted to a
  /// string value. The last expression is a relational equality check whether
  /// the left operand value is equal to the right operand value. `size` is a
  /// built in function which returns the length of an array. In this case the
  /// array length is 4 and this overall expression evaluates to true \(1\).
  ///
  /// ### **Associativity and Precedence of Operators**
  ///
  /// In expressions, operators have different precedence. Evaluation of the
  /// expressions is carried on according to the precedence of the operators.
  /// From simple algebra, multiplication precedes addition or subtraction,
  /// however division and multiplication have the same precedence.
  ///
  /// The precedence relation between the arithmetical, logical, special and
  /// relational operators implemented is as follows.
  ///
  /// | **Operators** | **Associativity** |
  /// | :--- | :--- |
  /// | \( \) " ' \[ \] | Left to right |
  /// | + - ! | Left to right |
  /// | \* / | Left to right |
  /// | + - | Left to right |
  /// | &lt; &lt;= &gt; &gt;= | Left to right |
  /// | == != | Left to right |
  /// | && | Left to right |
  /// | \|\| | Left to right |
  ///
  /// Operators in the same category have equal precedence with each other.
  /// Where duplicates of operators appear in the table, the first occurrence
  /// is unary, the second binary. Each category has an associativity rule:
  /// left to right. In the absence of parentheses, this rule resolves the
  /// grouping of expressions with operators of equal precedence. The precedence
  /// of each operator in table above is indicated by its order in the table.
  /// The first category \(on the first line\) has the highest precedence.
  /// Operators on the same line have equal precedence.
  ///
  /// ### Functions
  ///
  /// There are several **array**, **logical**, **text**, **object**,
  /// **mathematical**, **date & time**, **type conversion**, **validation**
  /// and **geolocation** functions implemented as expressions for performing
  /// advanced calculations and data manipulations. You can use these functions
  /// in your expressions.
  ///
  /// Each function has a name and zero or more input parameters. The number
  /// and type of input parameters are all specific to a function.
  ///
  /// > **Examples:**
  /// >
  /// > 1. ```
  /// >    STARTSWITH(main_text, search_text)
  /// >
  /// >    STARTSWITH("Jonh Adams", "Jon")
  /// >
  /// >    ```
  /// > 2. ```
  /// >    PRODUCT(number1, number2, ...)
  /// >
  /// >    PRODUCT(10, 23, 5, -75)
  /// >
  /// >    ```
  ///
  /// The first example above is the "STARTSWITH" function. This function checks
  /// whether a string starts with the characters of a search string, returning
  /// true or false as appropriate. It accepts two text parameters, _main text_
  /// and _search text_. The second example is the "PRODUCT" function. This
  /// function multiplies all the numbers given as arguments and returns the
  /// resulting number.  There is no fixed number of input parameter for this
  /// function. At a minimum it takes two parameters and maximum it can have 100.
  ///
  /// ### Data query expressions
  ///
  /// Altogic does not use a separate data query syntax \(e.g., SQL\) for
  /// selecting/filtering data from the database. **You use the same expression
  /// syntax described above and functions to query your data.**
  ///
  /// Assuming you have an imaginary product model with quantity \(integer\),
  /// weight \(decimal\), volume \(decimal\) and type \(text\) information.
  /// Below are some data query examples that you can create to fetch/filter
  /// your products data.
  ///
  /// > **Examples:**
  /// >
  /// > 1. ```
  /// >    quantity > 100 && quantity < 200 && type == "plastic"
  /// >    ```
  /// > 2. ```
  /// >    (weight / volume > 2 && type == 'metal') || (weight / volume <= 2 && type == 'plastic')
  /// >    ```
  ///
  /// The first data query above searches for products that are of type plastic
  /// and has a stock quantity between 100-200 items. The second data query
  /// search for products either metal and with a weight to volume ration
  /// greater than 2 or plastics with a weight to volume ration less than or
  /// equal to 2.
